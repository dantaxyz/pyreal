    "## Custom Transformers Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Pyreal generates ML explanations using Explainer objects, which take in data Transformers through their `transformer` parameter. These Transformers take in three flags in their initialization, two of which we will use in this tutorial:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Transformers with a `model=True` flag take data from the original feature space (as we loaded in above) to the feature space used by the model.\n",
    "- Transformers with an `interpret=True` flag take data from the original feature space to a feature space more readable or interpretable by humans. \n",
    "\n",
    "For information about the third transformer flag (`algorithm`), please see the [advanced_explanation_generation](pyreal\\tutorials\\advanced_explanation_generation.ipynb) tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pyreal `transformer` module has some common transformers available for used, but some use-cases may require you to write your own transformer. This can be done by extending the base `Transformer` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transformer Functions\n",
    "When defining a custom transformer, you will have to consider three types of functions:\n",
    "- `data_transform` (*required*): A single function that transforms the data from space A to B. \n",
    "- `inverse_transform_explanation_XXX` (*optional*): Functions that transform an explanation from space B to A. This type of function only needs to be considered if the transformer is used by the explanation algorithm and leads to the data being more obfuscated/less interpretable (ie, will have the `algorithm` flag set to True and the `interpret` flag set to False)\n",
    "- `transform_explanation_XXX` (*optional*): Functions that transform an explanation from space A to B. This type of function only needs to be considered if the transformer is used to make data and explanations more interpretable than the algorithm-ready state (ie, will have the `algorithm` flag set to False and the `interpret` flag set to True)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `transform_explantion` type functions are written per Explanation output type. For this tutorial, we will consider additive local feature contribution and additive global feature importance explanations. At the end of this tutorial, we will consider some special cases."

    "1. Define the transformer `__init__()` method, using a `super()` call for the parent `Transformer` class. The function can take optional arguments to configure the transformer. We will take in a list of columns to average.\n",
    "2. Define the `data_transform()` function, which takes an input DataFrame `x` and returns `x` after undergoing the transformation. In this case, we simply divide the selected columns by the households feature.\n",
    "3. Consider which flags we expect to be used with this transformer. In this case, our transformation will be used for the explanation algorithm, but also make the data more interpretable, so our flags are `interpret=True` and `algorithm=True`. Therefore, we do not need to define any explanation transform functions for this use case. \n",

    "\n",
    "1. Define the transformer `__init__()` method, using a `super()` call for the parent `Transformer` class. The function can take optional arguments to configure the transformer. In this case, we will not take in any parameters.\n",
    "2. Define the `data_transform()` function, which takes an input DataFrame `x` and returns `x` after undergoing the transformation. In this case, we convert long/lat values to nearby cities. \n",
    "3. Consider which flags we expect to be used with this transformer. In this case, our transformation will be used to make the data more interpretable, but will not be fed into the model, so our flags are `interpret=True` and `algorithm=model=False`. Therefore, the `transform_explanation` functions will be called, but not the `inverse_transform_explanation` functions.\n",
    "4. Consider the explanation output types you are interested in. For now, let's consider \n"
