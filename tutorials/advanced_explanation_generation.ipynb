    "## Simple Four-Feature-Spaces Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will work through an simple, artificial ML problem to illustrate the full `Pyreal` workflow, including four unique feature spaces and multiple explanation types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this tutorial, imagine that we are Trinket Sellers looking to price new Trinkets based on five peices of information, as described below. We are working with ML model developers who will help us train a simple model to predict prices, but we would also like some explanations to help us understand how these predictions come from the five peices of information. As you will see, Pyreal can help!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be predicting Trinket prices based on five peices of information:\n",
    "1. Trinket Type `type` (categorical)\n",
    "2. Trinket Color `color` (categorical)\n",
    "3. Trinket Age `age` (integer)\n",
    "4. Trinket Weight `width` (float)\n",
    "4. Trinket Height `height` (float)\n",
    "\n",
    "This information can be formatted in multiple ways - each of these introduces a new *feature space*. In this tutorial, we will go over how you can use Pyreal Explainers and Transformers to play with these four feature spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Original Feature Space\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we have been given the data in what we will refer to as the **original** feature space, or `X_orig`. This is an arbitrary feature space, that includes the information in whatever form our data-collection team happened to use. Let's load in and take a look at this space now.\n",
    "\n",
    "We see that we have seven columns, one each for items 1 through 4 above, plus three one-hot encoded columns for the `type` feature, which encodes three possible categories - `foo`, `bar`, and `foobar`. The color feature is listed using HTML color codes, which are not very understandable. The other three features are numeric, as expected."

    "Let's go ahead and train a model to predict the price variable from the features. To do so, we will first need to transform the data to a model-ready standpoint. Our ML development team has done their research and feature engineering, and suggested that a simple linear regression model may work well. They have also collected the following domain knowledge that may be useful for feature engineering:\n",
    "1. All trinkets are generally \"reddish\" or \"blueish\" - this is much more important to their price than the exact HTML color value.\n",
    "2. Bigger trinkets sell for more - but the difference between width and height is arbitrary. In fact, only the larger of these axis matter\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this information, combined with the requirements of a linear regression model, let's put together some transformers using Pyreal's `transformer` package, and take a look at what the model-ready feature space looks like. As you can see, this feature space includes one-hot encoded and aggregated features.\n",

By setting `model` to `True`, we are telling Pyreal Explainers that these transformers are required to get the data to the feature space expected by the model. Note that `model==True` is the default flag; for the purposes of being clear in this tutorial, we are setting it explicitly."
